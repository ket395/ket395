## Hi there

## the day (09 Apr) My primary domain - Engineering the Human Mind (not the perfectly fine hardware)

A software engineer engineers software systems. I love being a intermediate level ME, it makes al subdomains/branches of hard science and engineering simpler and approachable for me. ME engineers x systems. X is ?

I would like to be an expert software engineer unconstrained by programming languages by the end of Q3 of this year, focusing on Shadow IT which is the branch of IT that actually meets human needs while balancing security and safety at the risk of sometimes breaking compliance with literal interpretations of company IT policy.

Self sdvert - I'm a MS graduate in a humanities field. And one higher degree in astrophysics.

## [WARNING] - My personal and professional websites are don't exist, to explain, they are not owned/managed by me. You have been warned more than 3 times. Do not get scammed.

## Mastering categorical female psychology sans a professor's or supervisor's supervision

What could possibly go wrong? Somethings went wrong but then I clawed my way back, just kidding I took a midnight stroll in the beautiful stormclad moonlight like a unique nocturnal memeber of Hominidae family, why unique? Because unique I am.
