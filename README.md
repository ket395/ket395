## Hi there

## the day (09 Apr) My primary domain - Mental 3ngineering

A software engineer engineers software systems. I love being a intermediate level ME, it makes al subdomains/branches of hard science and engineering simpler and approachable for me. ME engineers x systems. X is ?

I would like to be an expert software engineer unconstrained by programming languages by the end of Q3 of this year, focusing on Shadow IT which is the branch of IT that actually meets human needs while balancing security and safety at the risk of sometimes breaking compliance with literal interpretations of company IT policy.

Self sdvert - I'm a MS graduate in a humanities field. And one higher degree in astrophysics.

## [WARNING] - My personal and professional websites are don't exist, to explain, they are not owned/managed by me. You have been warned more than 3 times. Do not get scammed.

## Mastering categorical female psychology sans a professor's or supervisor's supervision

What could possibly go wrong? Somethings went wrong but then I clawed my way back, just kidding I took a midnight stroll in the beautiful stormclad moonlight like a unique nocturnal memeber of Hominidae family, why unique? Because unique I am.

## BRAGGING

## Steps to view the faint and vague signals of my resume. Which are clear as day to the experts and engineers.

- Create a folder from which a web server is serving you local files if they ar present at suitable intervals otherwise idling for a fixed time period.

https://github.com/JeffHoogland/moksha/issues/278 LoL among other things, why would you use Bodhi Linux? and why are config files not stored in user's config directory? Sanity
is a rarity in some desktop environments.

## MoTD - Ensured fake theses of students and professors get the attention required. If you lost your shot at a PhD in CS twice after completing the work just stop. Multidisciplnary research is not for you.

Stay a PhD candiadate forever.

## Motto of the day (07 Mar) in ITRANS TRANSLITERATION - parampada sopaanam paTham 

PSP or MP or SAS that is, Vaikunthapali (in Andhra Pradesh). The original source of the Victorian England Snakes and Ladders. The Victorian version is more like a regression rather than evolution, an important lesson in relentless march of history. The Victorian version was way more forgiving as it contained equal numbers of each, removing the most important connection to the real world empirical insight of walking the right path being more difficult than the other one.
