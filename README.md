## Hi there

Remind your friends to never report issues to any repository in here https://github.com/Microsoft It's a monopoly, not open unless they profit 90% of the time, not collaborative unless they profit 90% of the time, not flexible. And if you've been living under a rock Google/DDG/Perplexity/search Microsoft scandals and snafus and shenanigans and drama with normal people. For more unpleasantness see Microsoft/VSCode repo.
