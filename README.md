## Hi there

## the day (09 Mar) My primary domain - Mental 3ngineering

A software engineer engineers software systems. I love being a intermediate level ME, it makes al subdomains/branches of hard science and engineering simpler and approachable for me. ME engineers x systems. X is ?

I would like to be an expert software engineer unconstrained by programming languages by the end of Q3 of this year, focusing on Shadow IT which is the branch of IT that actually meets human needs while balacning security and safety at the risk of sometimes breaking compliance with literal interpretations of company IT policy.
