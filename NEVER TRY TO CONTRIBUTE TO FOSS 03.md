Check out my kind of oldfangled, kinda newfangled, kinda cool, inevitably thought-provoking profile. And the limited mentorship opportunities for your no matter the non business major you have chosen be it - Bachelor's or Master's or Doctorates or Post-Doctorates. 

I won't be responding to further questions because I had to waste time confirming with the latest version when the version number alone was evidence enough to condemn the usage of this entire series of releases.
Since this code can't be built by most, it's not really FOSS or FLOSS, whatever you prefer to use. It is source available or shareware or freeware, whatever you want to call it.

Also I patched it to correctly import a database, it was easy but I didn't like the entire app so I removed it from the Android VM I was using for testing.

### Expected behavior

It just works TM.

### Actual behavior

It doesn't work but it does let you know it doesn't work.

### Additional information

Question about device model is - Irrelevant as all devices are affected as the bug is in the Tubular code. No where else.
