(Major? unsurprising) MS VSCode extension snafu by overeager uber ambitious security experts(that's what they call themselves)

https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-apologizes-for-removing-vscode-extensions-used-by-millions/

PSA - Don't post things even as a joke or you won't be able to even file issues on any repo on Microsoft despite totally no risks to anyone there and despite not mentioning any snafu related to a github.com/microsoft project. Which is very very sad for me, because I just realised this today, so what's next? Lots of actual work, no major or minor snafus.
